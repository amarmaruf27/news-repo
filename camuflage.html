                <p class="card-text">praying mantis has a unique ability to camouflage with its environment. This
                    ability can change its body color to resemble the place it perches. Unlike the mimicry ability
                    possessed by chameleons, the color of the mantis cannot change periodically. The color is
                    genetically inherited by its species.
                    The mantis will look for a suitable place to camouflage.</p>

                <p class="card-text">Praying mantises are clever predators that have a pair of sharp teeth on their
                    front legs. Apart from that, adult praying mantises can also fly. Praying mantises are assisted by
                    the type of chewing biting mouth that has a
                    cannibalistic nature, namely eating male praying mantises during copulation or mating. Flies, moths
                    and butterflies are other foods of these insects.
                    Like most insects, praying mantises also undergo a molting process. In its progress, praying
                    mantises experience at least 5 molting times. In this process, there will be a gap of about 10 days.
